# Introduction

LearnerEmotions aims to provide educators with a tool that makes it easier for them to monitor their student's emotions in real time. Additionally, the program can assist in creating a massive data source for several kinds of data science studies that employ the understanding of students' emotions as a factor of enhancing instruction. The most recent research on the importance of comprehending students' emotions in both teaching and learning is presented in the next section. 
LearnerEmotions is a web application that can run on students’ computers and access their frontal cameras in order to analyze their faces and detect their emotions. Figure 1 shows the student’s interface that displays in real time his face and a pie chart of percentages of his emotions during the actual session. These detected emotions are processed on the server side and saved in a database related to multiple other parameters like the concerned student, course title, course nature and many others. This application is primarily intended for teachers who want to analyze the emotions of their students during their course sessions, practical work or any type of teaching activity. It allows teachers to view their students' emotions in real time in simple mode or even in the form of dashboards.
